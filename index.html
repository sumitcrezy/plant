        <p class="lead">Human beings get their food & many resources from plants. The green expanse of the forests, filled with various types of plants, is where we primarily source our raw materials. Plants not only ensure the survival of the human race but also their prosperity, providing us with an abundance of resources that we utilize intelligently to make our lives easy & hassle-free.

Every time we step out, we witness the beautiful greens and a distinct variety of plants with different appearances and functions. That is why we, at JBM Global School recognized as one of the top schools in Noida, encourage our students to visit their nearby garden and see the many different types of plants found in nature.

Plants vary so much from each other due to their differing growth habits and characteristics. Let us learn more about the various categories that plants have been divided into..</p>
